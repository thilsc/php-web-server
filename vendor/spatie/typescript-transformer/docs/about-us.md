[Spatie](https://spatie.be) is a webdesign agency based in Antwerp, Belgium.

Open source software is used in all projects we deliver. Laravel, Nginx, Ubuntu are just a few of the free pieces of software we use every single day. For this, we are very grateful. 
When we feel we have solved a problem in a way that can help other developers, we release our code as open source software [on GitHub](https://spatie.be/opensource).

These typescript-transformer and laravel-typescript-transformer packages were made by [Ruben Van Assche](https://github.com/rubenvanassche). There are many other contributors for the [typescript-transformer](https://github.com/spatie/typescript-transformer/graphs/contributors) and [laravel-typescript-transformer](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-typescript-transformer/graphs/contributors) package who devoted time and effort to make this package better.
